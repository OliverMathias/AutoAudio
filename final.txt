'It's the only way to live... All that business of having the same old job, leaving home at such and such a time, coming back at such, and such a time... What a bore!, I don't know how I stuck it at the consulate! True enough, it's a bore, but that's not the point. What amazes me is how you've managed to have such a jolly time of,
it in this cretinous, bureaucratic country.',
'No problem!,
You can have a wonderful life here in Brazil, Castro.,
Did you know - by way of illustration  that I used to teach,
Javanese?',
'When?!,
Here?!,
After you came back from the consulate?',
'No, before.,
As a matter of fact, that's how I became consul.',
'Get away!..,
More beer?',
'Why not?',
I was in a coffee shop, telling my mate Castro how I'd connedI,
ordered some more bottles, we filled our glasses, and I continued:,
Td just arrived in Rio and was down on my luck, making midnight,
flits from one digs to another, without a clue how to make any,
money, when I came across an advertisement in the Jornal do,
Comrcio for a Javanese teacher.,
Testimonials required etc.,
Well, I said to myself, there ain't gonna be many applicants for,
that job!,
So I decided to learn a few words of Javanese and apply.,
I left the cafe I was in and strolled through the streets,,
imagining myself a Javanese teacher, earning money, able to afford,
the trolleybus, not being pestered by landlords...,
I headed, in a sort of reverie, to the National Library.,
I didn't really know what book I was looking for, but I walked in,,
left my hat with the doorman, picked up my ticket and went,
upstairs.,
'As I went up I had the bright idea of asking for the volume of,
the Cyclops Encyclopaedia containing the letter J, so I could look,
up an article about Java and the Javanese language.,
No sooner said than done.,
After a few minutes I'd discovered that Java is a large island in,
the Sonda Archipelago, a Dutch colony, and that Javanese is an,
agelutinative Malayo-Polynesian language with a _ respectable,
literature and a script derived from the ancient Brahmi alphabet.,
'The article cited some books about this Malayan language, so I,
asked for one of those.,
I ended up copying the alphabet, together with a latinised version,
of the pronunciation, after which I left and wandered the streets,,
chewing over the letters.,
'Hieroglyphs danced around in my head.,
From time to time I consulted my notes.,
I roamed the parks, only stopping to scrawl those funny letters in,
the sand of the paths in order to fix them in my brain and get,
used to writing them.,
T slipped into the house that night, avoiding unwanted questions,
from the commissionaire, and carried on ingesting that Malayan,
alphabet in my room, with such success that - come the morning  I,
knew it perfectly.,
Having convinced myself it was the easiest language in the world,,
I left, but not soon enough to give the lettings agent the slip:,
Ah, Mr Castelo!,
When are you going to settle your account?,
Shortly.,
You don't mind waiting a little bit longer?,
I'm about to be appointed Professor of Javanese and... 'He,
interrupted me: What the hell is that, Mr Castelo?,
which tickled me, so I decided to call upon his patriotism: It's a,
language spoken somewhere near Timor.,
You know where Timor is?,
'Ah!,
What an innocent soul!,
He immediately forgot about my debts and informed me, in his,
slushy Portuguese accent:Well... 'm not entirely sure, but I've,
heard that Timor is a part of our Empire, near Macau... And you,
speak that language, Mr Castelo?!,
'Once I'd got away  and feeling rather smug about my Javanese,
escape route  I pulled the advertisement out of my pocket again.,
There it was!,
Yessiree!,
I'm definitely gonna apply to be a professor of this Oceanian,
idiom.,
T wrote my application and went to hand it in at the offices of,
the Comrcio, after which I returned to the library and continued,
my study of Javanese.,
'But I didn't make much progress that day, possibly because it,
occurred to me that all a professor of this Malayan lingo really,
needs to know is the alphabet.,
Or perhaps I'd been concentrating too much on the bibliography and,
the literary history of my subject.,
'After two days I received a letter inviting me to an interview,
with Dr Manuel Feliciano Soares Albernaz, otherwise Baron,
Jacuecanga, in Count Bonfim Street  I don't recall the number.,
Don't forget I was carrying on, in the meantime, learning,
Malayan...,
I mean, Javanese.,
In addition to the alphabet I learnt the names of some authors and,
how to say How are you?,
plus two or three grammatical rules and a lexical grounding of,
about twenty words.,
'You can't imagine the struggle I had to try - in vain  to get the,
four hundred reais for my journey to Count Bonfim Street!,
Learning Javanese is much easier by comparison, believe you me...,
So I walked there and arrived hot and bothered.,
But an alley of old mango trees leading up to the Baron's house,
welcomed me tenderly, almost maternally  the only time in my whole,
life I've got anywhere near feeling close to nature.,
It was an enormous, apparently deserted house, run-down, but,
somehow - I thought  through neglect and world-weariness rather,
than poverty.,
It must have been years since it had last seen a coat of paint.,
The walls were peeling and here and there a tile  those,
oldfashioned glazed tiles - was missing from the eaves, making,
them like a set of rotting, untended teeth.,
T took a quick look at the garden and saw how the flat-sedge and,
beggar's-lice had driven out the angel-wings and begonias,,
although the drab crotons were holding on.,
I knocked.,
And waited...,
Eventually an ancient African appeared.,
His cottony hair and beard spoke of age, meekness and suffering.,
The living room was like a portrait gallery: a parade of pompous,,
big-bearded men in immense, gilded frames; and the sweet profiles,
of ladies in headbands and holding large fans, who looked as if,
they wanted to be wafted up to the heavens in their balloon-like,
dresses.,
But of all the antiques  which looked even more antique and,
venerable under the ubiquitous layers of dust -, what I liked most,
was a fine vase ofChinese porcelain... or Indian as it's sometimes,
called...,
The purity of that porcelain, its fragility, the simplicity of its,
design, its moonlight glimmer, told me it had been moulded in the,
hands of a dreaming child, to enchant the weary eyes of the old,
and disillusioned... T had to wait a little while for the owner of,
the house and it was with a feeling of deep respect that I saw him,
arrive, a little unsteady on his feet, and holding a Portuguese,
printed handkerchief from which he was taking snuff, like a,
picture from the olden times.,
I wanted to run away.,
Even if it wasn't him who was the student, it would be a crime to,
bamboozle that old man, whose age brought something sacred,,
something august, to the surface of my mind.,
I wavered... but waited.,
Ym the Javanese teacher you said you were looking for, sir.,
Sit down, the old man replied.,
Are you from here, from Rio?,
No, I'm from Canavieiras.,
From where?,
Speak up a bit  I'm deaf.,
Y'm from Canavieiras, in Bahia, I trumpeted.,
Where did you do your studies?,
In Sao Salvador.,
And where did you learn Javanese?,
he asked, with the doggedness of the elderly.,
'Even though I hadn't foreseen that question, I extemporised a,
lie: I told him my father was Javanese, a merchant sailor who'd,
ended up in Bahia, settled near Canavieiras as a fisherman, got,
married, prospered and it was from him that I'd picked up,
Javanese.',
'And he believed you?!,
The way you look?!',
asked my friend, who'd been listening quietly.,
T don't look that different from a Javanese.,
Straight hair, long and thick.,
Dark skin.,
I could easily pass for a Malayan half-cast.,
And you don't need me to tell you there are all sorts in Brazil:,
Indians, Malayans, Tahitians, Malagasies, Guanches, even Goths - a,
combobulation of racial types to make the rest of the world green,
with envy.',
'Alright...,
Carry on.',
'After listening attentively and giving me a good looking-over, it,
seemed the old man came to the conclusion I really was the son of,
a Malayan, because he asked me, almost in a whisper: So you'd be,
happy to teach me Javanese?,
'The words Of course I would left my lips before 'd even had time,
to think.,
You must be surprised, the Baron continued, that, at my age, I,
still want to learn something, but... Not at all!,
There are many, many admirable examples... You see, what I want,,
Mr...Castelo.,
My dear Mr Castelo, what I want is to honour a promise  a family,
promise.,
I don't know if you know...,
I'm the grandson of Counsellor Albernaz, the one who was with,
Pedro the First when he abdicated.,
He once came back from London with a book in a strange language  a,
book which fascinated him.,
It was a gift from an Indian or Siamese in London as a thank-you,
for some favour or other.,
When my grandfather was on his deathbed, he called my father and,
said: My boy, I've got a book here that's written in Javanese.,
The man who gave it me said it wards off harm and brings happiness,
to whoever owns and understands it.,
'm not so sure about that...,
But, in any case, look after it and, if you want the prophecy of,
that wise old oriental to come true, make sure your son,
understands it, so that happiness may pass from generation to,
generation of our family.',
My father wasn't inclined to believe the story, but he kept the,
book.,
When he, in turn, was nearing death's door, he gave it to me and,
told me what he'd promised my grandfather.,
At first I didn't give it much thought.,
I put it away and got on with my life.,
I ended up forgetting all about it, but recently I've had so many,
things go wrong, so much misfortune in my old age, that I,
remembered the family talisman.,
I need to read it, to understand it, and I don't want to pass bad,
luck to my descendants.,
But in order to read it I need  of course - to understand it.,
And there you have it!,
'He fell silent and I noticed there were tears in his eyes.,
He dried them quickly and asked me if I'd like to see the book.,
I said yes.,
He called his man-servant, gave him instructions and explained to,
me that he'd lost all his sons, his nephews and nieces, that all,
he had left was a married daughter who only had one son  an,
invalid, whose health was precarious.,
'The book arrived.,
It was an antique, quarto-sized tome, leatherbound, printed in,
large type on coarse, yellowing paper.,
The frontispiece was missing, so there was no date of publication.,
But it did have a few pages in English, by way of preface, where I,
read that it had to do with stories by Prince Kulanga, an,
outstanding Javanese writer.,
T immediately informed the old Baron, who  unaware I'd arrived at,
this knowledge via English - was greatly impressed by my knowledge,
of Malayan.,
I carried on leafing through the great volume, like a certified,
expert in that sort of gobbledegook, and before long we'd agreed,
the conditions: my fee and the hours.,
I undertook to make sure he could read the old tome within a year.,
'Soon I was giving my first lesson, but the old man was not as,
diligent as me.,
He couldn't learn to read and write even four letters.,
It took us a month to get halfway through the alphabet and,
youcouldn't say Baron Jacuecanga was much the wiser for his,
trouble.,
He kept forgetting what he'd just learnt.,
'His daughter and son-in-law, who I don't think were privy to the,
story of the book, found out about his studies, but they didn't,
object.,
They thought it was rather sweet  a good way to keep him occupied.,
'But wait till you hear, Castro, how the son-in-law admired the,
Javanese teacher!,
What an extraordinary thing!,
he kept saying.,
It's amazing!,
Such a young man!,
If I'd been able to speak Javanese, just think where I might be,
now!,
'Mrs Maria da Glria's husband - Mrs Maria was the Baron's daughter,
was a judge, well-connected and powerful; but that didn't stop him,
praising my Javanese in front of everyone.,
And the Baron, for his part, was as happy as could be.,
After two months he gave up his studies and asked me to translate,
a passage from the enchanted book every other day.,
He said just understanding it would do; there was no reason why he,
couldn't just listen while someone else translated.,
In that way he'd fulfil his duty whilst avoiding the tedium of,
study.,
'You won't be surprised to know I can't speak Javanese even now,,
but I made up some daft stories and palmed them off on the old man,
as if they were sacred scripture.,
The way he listened to that rubbish!,
He was ecstatic; you'd have thought he was listening to the words,
of an angel.,
And I rose even higher in his estimation!,
He insisted I live in his house, showered me with presents,,
increased my pay.,
To put it simply...,
I was having a rare old time.,
It helped greatly that he came into an inheritance from some,
forgotten relative of his in Portugal.,
The dear old man attributed his good fortune to my Javanese; and I,
was almost ready to believe it myself.,
'Although my guilt feelings were rapidly diminishing, I was still,
worried I'd bump into someone who really could speak that Malayan,
jabberjabber.,
And I was horrified when the kind-hearted old Baron sent me to,
Viscount Caruru with a letter recommending I be admitted to the,
diplomatic service.,
I did my darndest to dissuade him: I wasn't good-looking enough,,
wasn't elegant enough, looked like a Philippino.,
Nonsense!,
he replied.,
Off you go, my boy!,
You speak Javanese!,
So I went.,
The Viscount, in turn, sent me - heaped with recommendations - to,
the secretariat for foreigners.,
I'd been accepted.,
'The director summoned the section heads: Gentlemen, before you,
stands a man who speaks Javanese.,
What do you think about that?!,
'The section heads took me to meet the officials and the clerks,,
one of whom looked at me with hostility rather than envy or,
admiration.Meanwhile, all the others were asking me, So, you speak,
Javanese?,
Is it difficult?,
There's no one else who speaks it here.,
'Eventually the hostile-looking clerk piped up: That's true, but I,
speak Kanak... Can you speak Kanak?,
I said No and went off to be introduced to the minister.,
'His Eminence rose from his chair, stood arms akimbo for a moment,,
adjusted his pince-nez, and finally asked, So, you speak Javanese?,
1 said Yes and, in answer to his question about where I learnt it,,
I wheeled out the story about my Javanese father again.,
Right... said the minister.,
Nevertheless, your physical appearance is not ambassadorial.,
The best thing would be a consulate in Asia or Oceania.,
There are no vacancies at present, but I shall find you a place,
after the forthcoming re-organisation.,
Until then you will be an attach at the ministry here and next,
year you will go to Basel, where you will represent Brazil at the,
Linguistics Congress.,
In the meantime, study!,
Read Hove-Iacque, Max Miller etc.!,
'So there I was, knowing next to no Javanese, but employed by the,
foreign office, and about to represent Brazil at a learned,
congress!,
'Before long the old Baron died, leaving the book to his son-in-,
law until his grandson came of age, and leaving me a little,
something in his will.,
T launched myself enthusiastically into the study of the,
MalayoPolynesian languages, but it was no good!,
I was now well-fed, welldressed and enjoying my sleep; I simply,
didn't have the energy to force all that weird stuff into my head.,
I bought books and subscribed to journals: The Revue,
Anthropologique et Linguistique, the Proceedings of the Anglo-,
Oceanic Association, the Archivo Glottologico Italiano, you name,
it!,
All to no avail.,
But that didn't stop my fame growing.,
People would point me out in the street and proclaim: That's the,
man who speaks Javanese!,
Grammarians approached me in bookshops to ask me about the,
collocation of pronouns in that Sunda Islands lingo.,
I started receiving letters from learned people in the interior of,
Brazil, the papers used to cite me as an authority, and I turned,
down a request from a group of students who were anxious to,
understand the language.,
At the invitation of the editor of the Comrciol wrote a full-page,
article about ancient and modern Javanese literature...' 'How?!..,
seeing you knew nothing about it,' interrupted Castro, who'd been,
following every word.,
'Piece of cake!,
First I described the island of Java with the help of dictionaries,
and a few geography books and I padded out the rest with,
quotations.',
'And they never suspected?!',
asked my friend.,
'Never.,
That's to say, apart from one time when I almost came a cropper.,
The police arrested a bloke, a dark-skinned sailor who spoke,
